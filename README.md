## Introduction
This project demonstrates the integration of Twilio with Spring WebFlux, a reactive programming framework in Spring. The example showcases how to build a non-blocking, asynchronous application that sends messages using Twilio's API.

## What is Twilio?
Twilio is a cloud communications platform that enables developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive SMS messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs. Twilio is widely used for adding communication capabilities to applications.

## What is Reactive Programming?
Reactive Programming is a programming paradigm centered around asynchronous data streams and the propagation of change. Itâ€™s particularly suited for applications that require high performance, scalability, and responsiveness. Reactive systems are non-blocking and can handle large numbers of concurrent events, making them ideal for real-time applications.

## What is Spring WebFlux?
Spring WebFlux is a reactive web framework introduced in Spring 5. It allows you to build fully asynchronous and non-blocking web applications, using Reactor as its reactive library. WebFlux is designed to handle large numbers of concurrent connections, making it a great choice for building modern, reactive applications.

## Prerequisites
Java 21
Twilio Account (You can sign up here)
Twilio API Credentials (Account SID, Auth Token, and Phone Number having region enabled to which you want to send sms)

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/spring-webflux-twilio-example.git](https://github.com/l33t-c0d3r-66/twilio-sms-webflux.git)
```

### 2. Set Up Twilio Credentials
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and replace your_account_sid and your_auth_token in the application.properties with your Twilio account credentials.



## Conclusion
This example demonstrates how to leverage Spring WebFlux to create a reactive, non-blocking application that integrates seamlessly with Twilio's communication services. By using reactive programming, your application can handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently, making it a great choice for high-performance communication systems.
